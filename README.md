archivist
=========
A Python script to turn bars into autoloaders. 

Requires 7za.exe (http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) and cap.exe (https://drive.bitcasa.com/send/Lrb0VC6NsOEX5BNSDmGVn2mkeiSDklghCXlYuQk_YkRE) in the same folder as archivist.py and all of the OS/radio bars you intend to turn into loaders. 

Or, since it's a Python 3 app, make archivist.py an executable with cx_freeze (http://cx-freeze.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).
